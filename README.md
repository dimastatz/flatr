Here’s a draft **README.md** for your Python library **Flattr**, which flattens GitHub repositories into a single Markdown file:

---

# Flattr

**Flattr** is a Python library that takes any GitHub repository and creates a **flat Markdown (`.md`) file** containing the entire codebase and documentation. It is designed to make codebases **easier to read, analyze, and feed into LLMs** for tasks like code explanation, summarization, and interactive documentation.

---

## Features

* Fetch any public GitHub repository by URL.
* Flatten repository structure into a single Markdown file.
* Preserve folder and file hierarchy using Markdown headers.
* Wrap code in fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting.
* Include README and inline documentation.
* Optional metadata: file size, lines of code, last commit info.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install flattr
```

---

## Usage

```python
from flattr import Flattr

# Create a flat Markdown from a GitHub repo
repo_url = "https://github.com/user/example-repo"
flattener = Flattr(repo_url)
flattener.generate_md("output.md")
```

This generates a **self-contained Markdown file** with all code, docs, and structure from the repo.

---

## Example Output

````markdown
# Repository: ExampleRepo

## Folder: utils

### File: helpers.py
```python
def helper_function(x):
    return x * 2
````

### File: validators.py

```python
def validate(input):
    return input is not None
```

## Folder: main

### File: app.py

```python
from utils.helpers import helper_function
```

```

---

## Future Applications

- **Talk to Code**: Feed the flattened Markdown to LLMs for interactive code exploration and explanations.
- **Interactive README files**: Automatically generate detailed, readable documentation for any repository.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Ingest codebases into RAG pipelines for searchable, semantic documentation.
- **Automated Analysis**: Summarize, refactor, or detect issues across entire projects using AI models.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for new features, bug fixes, or multi-language support.

## License

If you want, I can also **draft the initial Python library structure and starter code** for Flattr so you can have a working prototype ready to generate Markdown from GitHub repos. Do you want me to do that?
