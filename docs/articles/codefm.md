# üéß CodeFM 
A GitHub ‚Üí Podcast Automation Pipeline

## **Overview**

This project aims to build an **automated pipeline** that converts any GitHub repository into a **funny 3‚Äì5 minute podcast** that explains the codebase in an engaging and entertaining way.

The system uses [**Flatr**](https://github.com/dimastatz/flatr) to flatten a repository into a single Markdown file, **Gemini** (LLM) to generate a humorous and informative podcast script, and **Kokoro TTS** to transform that script into a natural, expressive audio narration.

The end result: a fully automated ‚Äú**Code-to-Podcast**‚Äù system that turns open-source code into a story ‚Äî informative for developers, fun for everyone.

---

## **Objectives**

1. **Make codebases fun and accessible** by turning them into humorous, story-driven podcasts.
2. **Automate** the process of extracting, summarizing, and narrating technical content.
3. **Generate audio content at scale** for any public GitHub repository.

---

## **System Architecture**

### **1. Input Layer**

* **User Input:** GitHub repository URL
* **Example:**

  ```
  https://github.com/dimastatz/flatr
  ```

### **2. Repository Processing (Flatr)**

* **Tool:** [Flatr](https://github.com/dimastatz/flatr)
* **Action:** Flatten the GitHub repository structure into a single, human-readable Markdown file (`README_FLAT.md`).
* **Purpose:** Consolidate code and documentation into a compact form that Gemini can easily understand.

### **3. Script Generation (Gemini)**

* **Input:** Flattened Markdown file
* **Model:** Google **Gemini**
* **Prompt Example:**

  ```
  You are a funny podcast scriptwriter. Read the following Markdown that represents a GitHub repository.
  Create a 3‚Äì5 minute entertaining podcast script that humorously explains what this codebase does,
  who might have written it, and what problems it solves ‚Äî as if narrating to curious developers and tech lovers.
  ```
* **Output:** A short, witty, and educational podcast script (intro, middle, outro).

### **4. Audio Generation (Kokoro TTS)**

* **Input:** Podcast script text
* **Engine:** **Kokoro TTS** (Text-to-Speech)
* **Output:** High-quality MP3 or WAV file (~3‚Äì5 minutes long)
* **Features:**

  * Natural, expressive, humorous voice
  * Adjustable tone and pacing
  * Optional voice styles for variety

### **5. Optional Post-Processing**

* Add intro/outro music
* Include sound effects or transitions
* Package metadata and cover art for publishing

## **Implementation Plan**

| Phase | Task                             | Tools              | Deliverable             |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **1** | Set up repo cloning & flattening | Flatr, GitHub API  | Flattened Markdown      |
| **2** | Integrate Gemini API             | Gemini API         | Humorous podcast script |
| **3** | Connect Kokoro TTS               | Kokoro API         | Audio narration (MP3)   |
| **4** | Automate pipeline                | Python / FastAPI   | End-to-end automation   |
| **5** | Deploy as web service            | Cloud Run / Vercel | Public web interface    |

---

## **Expected Outcomes**

* Fully automated ‚ÄúGitHub ‚Üí Funny Podcast‚Äù pipeline
* 3‚Äì5 minute MP3 episodes that explain codebases in a lighthearted tone
* Scalable tool to bring humor and understanding to open-source projects

---

## **Example Use Case**

**Input:**

```
https://github.com/dimastatz/flatr
```

**Output:**
üéôÔ∏è *"Welcome to CodeCast! Today we‚Äôre flattening your repo ‚Äî literally! Let‚Äôs see how Flatr squeezes an entire codebase into one tidy Markdown file, saving developers from endless folder spelunking..."*

## **Team & Roles**

* **AI Developer:** Build pipeline and integrate APIs
* **LLM Engineer:** Craft Gemini prompts and refine humor tone
* **Audio Engineer:** Tune Kokoro voices and add effects
* **Project Lead:** Oversee milestones and ensure project delivery

Would you like me to append a **‚ÄúHow It Works‚Äù section** with a short example of Python API calls for Flatr, Gemini, and Kokoro (so others can reproduce it)?
